                The purpose of this project is to design a web application for K-12 Students to classify types of bees for educational purposes. This web app is being built in Angular 1.0. AngularJS is the web application framework we are using in order to allow for easier front-end and back-end integration. The intention is that the app will include a dichotomous key that will make it easier for students to identify the bees that they encounter. Ultimately, students will be able to take pictures of bees that will be geotagged and sent along with information from the dichotomous key to our database. Since the targeted audience is younger school children, the UI of the application is very streamlined and minimalistic to allow for easy, focused and intuitive user experience.

                <b>Spring 2017</b>: I worked on the CS team (database-subteam). I created the relevant tables and added in the dichotomous key data (stored as bitstrings) into the tables. I assisted team members in debugging the integration of the camera functionality into the app.
