                        <b>About Me</b>:
                        <br>
                        I am a born and raised Atlantian and still reside in Atlanta, GA. I am currently a rising third year at the Georgia Institute of Techology where I am majoring in chemical engineering and minoring in computer science. In the future, I see myself working in the RnD department of a materials development company working on creating next generation plastcs. I am interested in Discrete Mathematics, Powerlifting, Chai, and Web Design.

                        I coded this website from scratch and every line of code is hand-written. I learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript through the successes and pitfalls I encountered during the development of this website (Shoutout to Google and Lynda.com tutorials). I am still actively furthering these skills and am always looking for new ways to add to to the site's aesthetic. If you have any thoughts/ideas about the site (praise preferred but not required) or just want to take a look under the hood and look at the source code, feel free to checkout the github repo for the website (<a class="gh-link"  href="http://www.github.com/alishan-kaisani/website"><b>here</b></a>).
